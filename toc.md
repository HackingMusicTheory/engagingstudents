_Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy_ presents short essays on the subject of student-centered learning, and serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

This volume contains essays dealing with theory ([Shaffer and Hughes](shafferintro.html), [Jacobus](jacobus.html)), practice ([Burke](burke.html), [Colletti](colletti.html), [Johnson](johnson.html), [Roust](roust.html), [Schubert](schubert.html)), assessment ([Alegant and Sawhill](alegantSawhill.html), [Gawboy](gawboy.html), [Rifkin](rifkin.html)), and technology ([de Clercq](deClercq.html), [Duker](duker.html), [Gosden](gosden.html), [Ludwig](ludwig.html), [Peebles](peebles.html)) as they relate to music pedagogy. 

We hope that you enjoy reading this volume as much as we have enjoyed putting it together.
