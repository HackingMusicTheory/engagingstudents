For years I read to my students out of the textbook—that was my classroom lecture. When I taught harmony out of Aldwell and Schachter, I’d tell them which pages to skip, and when to substitute “never” for “occasionally.” I’d play the musical examples and tell the class what to look for in each one. In my own counterpoint texts one finds coy hints about things to discover in the musical examples (e.g., “The second counterpoint… may in some way illustrate the obsessive quality of jealousy”), but I couldn’t wait for the class to find the cool feature in Willaert’s duo—I blurted it out right away: *“There’s a pattern seven quarters long that repeats three times!”* (See my [Modal Counterpoint, Renaissance Style](http://openlibrary.org/books/OL16717055M/Modal_counterpoint_Renaissance_style), p. 170.)

It was pretty boring for all concerned, although it did ensure that the homework tasks were clearly defined. I did it because, beginning in the eighties, my colleagues and I ruefully acknowledged that “students simply don’t read any more.” Saddest of all, not only did they not read the text, they didn’t read the musical examples.

But those days are over! A few years ago I concluded that the best use of classroom time is public student activities, with a good dose of personal engagement. (I described the origins of these principles in “Global Perspective on Music Theory Pedagogy: Thinking in Music,” [*Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy*](http://jmtp.ou.edu) 25 [2011]: 217-233.) These activities permit a closer monitoring of each student’s strengths, weaknesses, and progress; they encourage students to develop musicality as well as musicianship; and they allow students to learn from each other as well as the textbook and the teacher. Above all, they motivate the student by relating music theory to music making. In the following paragraphs, I will comment briefly on contrapuntal classroom activities and the roles of the textbook and homework.

## The Classroom ##

The interaction between students and teacher can take the form of discussion, as in other humanities courses, but in music it must more frequently take the form of “speaking” the foreign language, in this case, music. Students can “speak” it to each other in the presence of the class and the teacher. One student can improvise something or play one line of a homework assignment and sing the other. Then the rest of the class can sing it back, write it down, and comment, applaud, or gently criticize.  I have elsewhere made a case for using improvisation in the classroom, and [several instructional videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/peterschubertmusic) are available. I encourage my students to improvise their homework, and to practice at home for their classroom performance, which eases the anxiety. Even if public classroom improvisation means at first riding roughshod over the rules for a time and producing hideous monstrosities, eventually the students’ comfort level with the material will increase, and each student is motivated by having something personal at stake: “speaking” his or her original musical statement.

I tell them it’s like when they start to take French in high school, and after the first day their grandmother asks them to “say something in French.” Now if she asks, “say something in music,” they’ll have something to say (and it won’t be a rote formula like the stale copybook phrase *la plume de ma tante est sur le bureau de mon oncle*).

Student comments on their musical experiences can be helpful to other students and to the teacher. I have learned a lot from students in sessions of this type. A couple of examples occurred recently when I was teaching stretto fuga, a technique for improvising a note-against-note canon after one note (this was a technique practiced by boys improvising in church). In my textbook, the melodic motions allowed for making stretto fuga are printed in a line of text, like this:

> imitation at the fifth above: sing or write 1 3­  5­ 4¯ 2¯

(This means the leading voice may stay on the same note move up a third or a fifth, or down a fourth or a second.)

…but in one class I wrote them vertically (on a staff), like this:

… and a clever student observed that the vertical layout made it easier to spot the correct melodic motion (especially under the pressure of being the leader).

In another class on stretto fuga improvisation, when one student was having difficulty following the leader, a classmate chimed in, saying that he had found that once you have started singing your note, you have to immediately ignore the note you are singing yourself, and shift your attention to the other person’s line. This is an essential tactic for succeeding at stretto fuga, and could lead to a richer musical behavior under performance circumstances. Nadia Boulanger used to suggest that a violinist playing a sonata should be able to sing the bass line of the accompaniment while playing the solo line. If a good performance entails attending to other parts, then stretto fuga will be a useful step towards developing that skill.

These observations (lining up the intervals and attending to the other part) are personal, based on discoveries by individuals, and I want my classroom to be a place where such exploration can take place. In the old days, most of the personal contact I had with my students’ musicality was in the comments I wrote on their homework assignments, or made in my office hours.

Another good use of classroom time is to get students acquainted with unfamiliar repertoire. We bemoan the fact that they don’t seem to know any Bach, much less any Palestrina. Classroom time is well spent if the teacher can convey not only general enthusiasm for a composer, but features or specific moments in a piece that are particularly lovable—and some students will immediately “get it.” Getting to know a whole piece from the inside, and occasionally returning to it to observe some technique that is the subject of homework, is essential to putting the homework in its place as an exercise that has an obvious utility in making something like the lovable piece.

## The Textbook and Homework ##

If classroom time is to be spent on one student haltingly playing and singing her homework or improvising, the class haltingly singing back and commenting, and the teacher enthusiastically raving about the merits of Willaert, then how does the written work get done? The answer is the textbook, which the students read on their own, and the homework, which they likewise do on their own.

In order for this to work, the textbook has to speak directly to the student, and the instructions for the exercises have to be crystal clear. Think of a textbook; can you really turn your students loose on it with no explanation?  Why not? Too long-winded? Too complicated? Pitched too high? I think many textbooks are manifestos secretly aimed at the teachers who will teach from them. I suppose we textbook writers secretly want to brainwash the teachers first, and only afterwards the students.

## Conclusion ##

If the most important thing to me is that my students be musically active in front of each other, I have to do it in the only place where I’m legitimately in charge: the classroom. Under these circumstances I am both a drill sergeant (“next person to the piano”) and a facilitator (“what do you like about that solution?”), and I need a textbook that is a true DIY manual. It’s probably not possible for the MUSICLE classroom to be wholly like Sugata Mitra’s “Self-organized Learning Environment” ([SOLE](http://www.ted.com/pages/sole_toolkit)), which is “curious, engaged, social, collaborative, motivated by peer-interest, and fueled by adult encouragement and admiration,” but there are definite advantages to moving in that direction.
