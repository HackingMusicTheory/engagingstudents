title: Engaging Students â€“ Essays in Music Pedagogy
---
_Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy_ presents short essays on the subject of student-centered learning, and serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

The motivation behind the assembly of this collection was drawn in part from our vision for a new format for scholarly communication based upon collaborative and swift peer review. We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time. Authors received feedback quickly, and the revision process consisted of efficient online interactions with the editorial group.

This volume contains essays of both a philosophical and practical nature on a wide range of topics, including (but not limited to) assessment, learning outcomes, in-class and out-of-class activities, and technology. Throughout, you will find a balance between essays dealing with more general topics (for example, strategies for dealing with different learning styles in a variety of contexts) and those dealing with more specific topics (for example, guidelines for using a specific computer application that has proven especially useful in mastering a particular skill or concept).

We hope that you enjoy reading this volume as much as we have enjoyed putting it together.
